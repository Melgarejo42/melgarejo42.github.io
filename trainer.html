    Certainly! Practicing with operators is essential for mastering JavaScript. Here are some exercises focusing on different types of operators:

<strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong>

Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
Write a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
Write a program that calculates the perimeter of a triangle given its three sides.


Assignment Operators:

Write a program that calculates compound interest using the compound assignment operator (+=).
Write a program that updates the value of a variable using the decrement (--) or increment (++) operator.


Comparison Operators:

Write a program that compares two numbers and checks if they are equal.
Write a program that determines if a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator (%).


Logical Operators:

Write a program that checks if a given number is within a specific range (e.g., between 10 and 20) using logical AND (&&) and logical OR (||) operators.
Write a program that determines if a given year is a leap year using logical NOT (!) operator.


Bitwise Operators:

Write a program that performs bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations on two numbers and prints the results.
Write a program that checks the binary representation of a number to see if it's a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).


Ternary Operator:

Write a program that determines if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using the ternary operator (condition ? expression1 : expression2).


String Operators:

Write a program that concatenates two strings.
Write a program that extracts a substring from a given string using the substring operator (substring()).
